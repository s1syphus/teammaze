Rough Calendar for Mike - Created January 31st, 2014

	Date:				Task:

	February 12			- Change maze generation - based on length of maze (number of roadblocks)
						Will be altered later for "levels" after database is updated
					- Add settings menu
						- User account login (non-functional)
						- ASK settings (talk to Chris M.)

	February 26			- Re-make back-end database
						- Re-design if needed and make sure all needed fields exist
						- Add multiple users
						- Add question levels
					- Fix selection on android to be several but not all categories
					
	March 12			- Sync questions with database
						- Log-in on android working with database
						- Change sync "format" (csv)
						- Make secure

	March 26			- Analytics from database on the website
						- Basic statistics (question-type and difficulty)
						- Display a graph on website

	April 9				- Implement maze-size difficulty changes (ie higher levels => more roadblocks/longer maze path)


	April 22			- Spaced-repetition of questions
						- Missed questions occur more frequently
						- This is non-essential but would be beneficial and should be
						  do-able after analytics can be created/pulled from database
