2. If you don't have access to the ASK Scanning Library give Erika your github username (emjansen@umich.edu)
   Then Clone a copy of Chris's ASK Scanning Library from: https://github.com/emjansen/ASKScanningLibrary
   
3. If you don't already have eclipse download the Android SDK bundle from: http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

4. Import both projects into eclipse
   File > Import > Existing Android Code Into Workspace 
   Browse to the folder containing the cloned repository > Finish

5. Add the ASK scanning library to the TeamMaize project (if it isn't already) 
   Right click on TeamMaize folder in eclipse
   Properties > Android > 
   Under Library click "Add…" Select ASKScanningLibrary (should show up if has been imported)
